# Indiana-University-Chest-X-Rays-Automated-Report-Generation
Develop a deep neural network that generates report given an image of radiography(X-ray)

# 1. Problem Description
Chest X-rays produce images of our heart, lungs, blood vessels, airways, and the bones of our chest and spine. These images help doctors determine whether a patient has heart problems, a collapsed lung, pneumonia, broken ribs, emphysema, cancer or any of several other conditions. A chest X-ray is often among the first procedures that a patient undergoes when a doctor suspects any disease. Related to heart or lung.

A chest X-ray can reveal many things inside your body, including:
<ul>
<li>The condition of your lungs</li>
<li>Heart-related lung problems</li>
<li>The size and outline of your heart</li>
<li>Blood vessels.</li>
<li>Calcium deposits</li>
<li>Fractures</li>
</ul>


Examining x-ray images for large number of patients manually can be very time consuming and cause delay. Also the chances of human error will be very high. It would be so wonderful if we could generate the reports accurately based on the x-ray images automatically, so that the reports can provided with minimal delay and remove any chances of any human error. If the model find some serious health issue, then we can involve the experts and thus minimize the stress on the healthcare sector.

# 2. Application of Deep learning Algorithms to our problem
Develop a deep neural network that generates report given an image of radiography(X-ray).
    
# 3. Source of Data
Open-i has a collection of chest X-Ray Images from the Indiana University hospital network. Data contains two folders, one for X-ray Images and the other for the XML report of radiography. For each report, there could be multiple images.
